I've always been passionate about technology and i've decided to make a turn in my career and start studying to be a developer. Since then i never stop studying and i always try to be in up to date.

Some of the core-technologies i work with:

. HTML, CSS, Javascript(ECMA 6).
. Sass/Styled Components
. React/Typescript
. Testing with Mocha&Chai/Jest
. Node JS/Express
